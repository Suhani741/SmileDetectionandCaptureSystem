# SmileDetectionandCaptureSystem
This project is a simple yet effective implementation of real-time smile detection using Python and OpenCV. By leveraging Haar Cascade Classifiers, the system detects human faces and identifies smiles from a live webcam feed. Once a smile is detected, the system automatically captures and saves three images, making it ideal for applications like photo booths, interactive kiosks, smart mirrors, or emotion-based automation systems.

Features:
Live webcam video processing
Real-time face and smile detection
Automatic capture of smiling images (up to 3)
Lightweight and easy to deploy
No training required (uses pre-trained Haar classifiers)

Technologies Used:
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)
Haar Cascade XML models
NumPy and OS modules

Applications:
Emotion-aware systems
Smart camera applications
Virtual classrooms
Interactive booths and public displays
